### Purpose
This document details the requirements for a system which uses an online database (CoinGecko) to enable users to analyze cryptocurrency statistical data. It examines the details and scenarios pertaining to both the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, and the distribution of activities towards the development of the program.
### Overview
The aim of the project is to implement a trading system that display’s to the user interface, for a given list of trade brokers, the data of a chosen set of crypto coins. The CoinGecko API will be used to retrieve the relevant cryptocurrency information.

CoinGecko is an online analytic database used for cryptocurrencies. It tracks a variety of cryptocurrency statistical data such as the purchase and sale of crypto coins, the date of the aforementioned transaction and the quantities of said currency.

The objectives of this project are the following: 1) allow the user to define trading brokers; 2) allow each broker to declare interest for a list of crypto coins they wish to obtain prices for; 3) attach a trading strategy to each trading broker, 4) retrieving crypto coin price data from CoinGecko’s site; 5) notify each broker with the crypto coin prices they declared interest in; and 6) display on the user-interface the trading log and trading activity.

Non-functional requirements such as the user interface and the targeted development environment are additional considerations within the context of platform deployment.
